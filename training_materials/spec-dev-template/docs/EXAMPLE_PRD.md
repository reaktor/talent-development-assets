## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

* Users discover the app via a direct link, invite, or company portal.

* Landing page offers simple login/signup (Google SSO and email/password).

* First-time users are greeted with a guided onboarding: a short tooltip tour highlighting the workspace, task creation, and assignment features.

* Initial workspace setup (name, invite users) is prompted, but can be skipped or visited later.

**Core Experience**

* **Step 1:** User logs in and lands on their personal dashboard, displaying all tasks assigned to them and tasks they’ve created.

  * Clean, uncluttered UI with a prominent "Add Task" button.

  * Immediate error messaging for invalid logins or session issues.

  * Success: User sees their workspace populated accordingly.

* **Step 2:** User creates a new task from the dashboard.

  * Modal or inline form appears: title, description, due date, priority, and assignee(s).

  * Input validation (required fields, date formats).

  * Upon creation, the task appears instantly in the relevant workspace views.

* **Step 3:** User assigns task(s) to one or more team members.

  * Autocomplete/select users from workspace roster.

  * Task creator is notified on successful assignment.

  * Assigned users receive in-app and email notification.

* **Step 4:** Team members comment, mark as complete, or reassign as needed.

  * Inline comment threads under each task.

  * Instant visual feedback on status changes.

* **Step 5:** Tasks are updated or filtered based on user preferences (status, assignee).

  * Filters are accessible in a sidebar or dropdown.

  * Any changes sync in real time across user sessions.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

* Users can attach simple files or links to tasks (future phase).

* Error handling for unreachable users (e.g., email invite not accepted).

* Graceful handling of deleted users/tasks.

* Escalation for overdue, high priority, or blocked tasks.

**UI/UX Highlights**

* High-contrast color scheme and large clickable areas for accessibility.

* Intuitive drag-and-drop task reordering for power users.

* Responsive design ensures usability on desktops, tablets, and phones.

## Narrative

Sarah leads a remote marketing team scattered across three time zones. Previously, they struggled to keep track of responsibilities—tasks were lost in email threads, and deadlines were missed when ownership was unclear. With the Multi-User Todo Application, Sarah quickly sets up a team workspace and invites everyone to join. She can easily create tasks, assign them to specific team members, and clarify priorities directly in the app.

As each team member logs in, they see only the tasks relevant to them, can comment to request clarifications, and mark work complete when finished. Real-time notifications ensure everyone stays aligned, while overdue or at-risk tasks are surfaced to Sarah for quick action.

The result? Sarah’s team collaborates far more effectively: accountability is clear, no task slips through the cracks, and the team has more time to focus on creative work—instead of chasing status updates. The business sees improved project turnaround and higher team morale.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* Relational database for storing users, tasks, workspaces, comments, and permissions.

* Front-end SPA rendered in the browser, powered by modern JS frameworks.

* Real-time sync layer (e.g., WebSockets or Pusher-like service) for collaborative features.

### Integration Points

* OAuth or SSO provider for authentication (Google, email).

* SMTP or transactional mail API for invite and notification emails.

* Optional integration points: calendar sync, notifications (future phase).

### Data Storage & Privacy

* Secure, encrypted storage of user data both in transit and at rest.

* GDPR-compliant data handling, including right-to-be-forgotten for deleted users.

* Data access limited by role-based permission model.

### Scalability & Performance

* Scale-out architecture for backend instances as user base grows.

* Efficient web sockets/message queue for real-time updates.

* Optimize front-end for sub-second page load and updates.

### Potential Challenges

* Handling complex real-time concurrency (e.g., simultaneous task edits).

* Preventing data leakage (strong RBAC).

* Ensuring smooth onboarding and first-use performance under load.

* Basic DDoS and spam protection for open workspace invites.
