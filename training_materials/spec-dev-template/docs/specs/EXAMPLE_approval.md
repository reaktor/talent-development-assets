## 1. Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** Task Approval System

**Feature Description:** A comprehensive task approval system enabling authorized users to review and approve completed tasks, transitioning them from "Done" to "Closed" status. This feature ensures proper task completion validation with approval workflows to maintain quality control and project governance.

**Goal:** Provide secure, auditable task approval that enables 100% task completion verification.

## 2. Functional requirements (User Behaviors)

This section uses Gherkin syntax to describe the feature's behavior from the user's perspective. Each scenario acts as a clear, testable requirement.

```gherkin
Feature: Task Approval System

Scenario: Task Approval Request
  Given I am a project manager
  And I have a task in "Done" status
  When I click "Request Approval" on the task
  Then the task status changes to "Pending Approval"
  And an approval notification is sent to assigned approvers
  And I see a message "Approval request submitted successfully"

Scenario: Task Approval by Authorized User
  Given I am an authorized approver
  And I receive a task approval notification
  And the task is in "Pending Approval" status
  When I review the task details
  And I click "Approve" on the task
  Then the task status changes to "Closed"
  And the task creator is notified of approval
  And I see a message "Task approved successfully"

Scenario: Task Rejection with Feedback
  Given I am an authorized approver
  And I receive a task approval notification
  And the task is in "Pending Approval" status
  When I review the task details
  And I enter rejection feedback "Missing documentation"
  And I click "Reject" on the task
  Then the task status changes to "Done"
  And the task creator receives rejection notification with feedback
  And I see a message "Task rejected with feedback"

Scenario: Bulk Task Approval
  Given I am an authorized approver
  And I have multiple tasks in "Pending Approval" status
  When I select multiple tasks for approval
  And I click "Approve Selected"
  Then all selected tasks change to "Closed" status
  And task creators are notified of approval
  And I see a message "X tasks approved successfully"

Scenario: Approval Deadline Expiration
  Given I have a task in "Pending Approval" status
  And the approval deadline has passed
  When the system processes expired approvals
  Then the task status changes to "Done"
  And the task creator receives a notification about deadline expiration
  And the approver is notified of the expiration
```

## 3. Technical requirements

This section details the engineering work for each Gherkin scenario.

### 3.1 Backend Functionality

**Approval Workflow:** Implements task approval request and processing workflow as defined in the "Task Approval Request" and "Task Approval by Authorized User" scenarios.

**Rejection Flow:** Handles task rejection with feedback mechanism and status reversion as defined in the "Task Rejection with Feedback" scenario.

**Validation requirements:**
- User authorization checking for approval permissions
- Task status validation (only "Done" tasks can be approved)
- Approval deadline enforcement
- Input sanitization for feedback
- Notification delivery confirmation
- Bulk operation validation

### 3.2 Frontend Functionality

**UI Components:**
- **TaskApprovalCard:** Task details display with approve/reject actions
- **ApprovalQueue:** List of pending approval tasks with filtering
- **BulkApprovalPanel:** Multi-select interface for bulk operations
- **ApprovalHistory:** Timeline of approval actions and feedback
- **ApprovalDashboard:** Overview of approval metrics and pending tasks

**Associated Behavior:** Implements complete approval workflow with proper state management and real-time updates.

### 3.3 Database Design

**Indexes required:**
- Primary: `id` (unique) on tasks table
- Primary: `id` (unique) on taskApprovals table
- Primary: `id` (unique) on approvalNotifications table
- Foreign Key: `taskId` references tasks.id on taskApprovals table
- Foreign Key: `approverId` references users.id on taskApprovals table
- Index: `status` on tasks table for filtering
- Index: `createdAt` on taskApprovals table for timeline queries

**Approval Tables:**
- **tasks:** Core task information with status tracking (Done, Pending Approval, Closed)
- **taskApprovals:** Approval records with approver, timestamp, and feedback
- **approvalNotifications:** Notification tracking for approval requests and responses
- **approvalPermissions:** User roles and approval permissions by project/category

**Security Implementation:**
- Role-based access control for approval permissions
- Audit logging for all approval actions
- Automatic deadline enforcement
- Secure notification delivery

## 4. Manual Verification Protocol

### Test Case 1: Complete Approval Flow
*Maps to "Task Approval Request" and "Task Approval by Authorized User" scenarios*

1. **Step 1:** Create a task and mark it as "Done"
2. **Step 2:** Request approval and verify status change to "Pending Approval"
3. **Step 3:** Login as approver and review task details
4. **Step 4:** Approve task and confirm status change to "Closed"

**Expected Result:** Task successfully transitions from Done → Pending Approval → Closed with proper notifications.

### Test Case 2: Rejection and Feedback Flow
*Maps to "Task Rejection with Feedback" scenario*

1. **Step 1:** Submit task for approval
2. **Step 2:** Login as approver and review task
3. **Step 3:** Reject with feedback and verify status reversion
4. **Step 4:** Confirm task creator receives rejection notification

**Expected Result:** Task rejected with feedback, status reverted to "Done", notifications sent.

### Test Case 3: Bulk Operations and Deadline Management
*Maps to "Bulk Task Approval" and "Approval Deadline Expiration" scenarios*

1. **Step 1:** Create multiple tasks and request approval
2. **Step 2:** Test bulk approval functionality
3. **Step 3:** Set approval deadline and wait for expiration
4. **Step 4:** Verify automatic deadline handling

**Expected Result:** Bulk operations work correctly, deadlines are enforced automatically.

## 5. Implementation Plan
